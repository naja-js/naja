# UI binding

As soon as Naja is initialized, it attaches its handler to all links, forms and submit inputs that match a configured selector. By default, the selector is `.ajax`, i.e. all you have to do is to add the `ajax` class to your links and forms that you want to be handled asynchronously:

```html
<a n:href="refresh!" class="ajax">Refresh</a>

<form n:name="form" class="ajax">
    <input n:name="submit">
</form>

<form n:name="otherForm">
    <input n:name="submit" class="ajax">
</form>
```


## Custom selector

You can easily customize the bound selector, e.g. change it to a data attribute, invert the behaviour, or even provide an empty selector to attach AJAX behaviour to *all* links and forms. Note that this must be configured *before* calling `naja.initialize()`:

```js
naja.uiHandler.selector = '[data-naja]';
// or
naja.uiHandler.selector = ':not(.synchronous)';
// or
naja.uiHandler.selector = '';
```

### Allowed origins

If you change the selector to an opt-out (`:not(.synchronous)`, empty string, etc.), *all* links will become asynchronous. Naja prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot with cross-origin AJAX requests and does not handle external URLs unless you explicitly allow them:

```js
naja.uiHandler.allowedOrigins.push('https://allowed.origin.com:4000');
```

The current origin is allowed by default, i.e. it does not matter whether the `href` of the link points to a relative URL or an absolute one.


## Manual bind

You can manually bind Naja's handler to DOM elements that are created dynamically via a different mechanism than snippets:

```js
const element = document.createElement('a');
element.href = '/link-target';
element.classList.add('ajax');
document.body.appendChild(element);

naja.uiHandler.bindUI(element);
```

The `bindUI` method searches the given `element` and its children for elements that match the configured selector and attaches Naja's handler to them.


## Manual dispatch

Naja exposes two helper methods for dispatching UI-bound requests manually, `clickElement(link)` and `submitForm(formOrSubmitter)`. The target element **does not** have to be bound to Naja via the configured selector. However, the aforementioned [allowed origin rules](#allowed-origins) still apply.

Both of these methods optionally accept the `options` object that you can use to configure the request:

```js
naja.uiHandler.clickElement(link, { history: false });
```

Both of them return the promise from the [underlying call to `naja.makeRequest()`](dispatch.md#handling-the-response):

```js
naja.uiHandler.clickElement(link)
	.then((payload) => { /* process payload */ });
```

### Manual form submission

The `submitForm()` method has been especially useful if you needed to submit a form programmatically — such as when a value of an input changes — because `form.submit()` does not trigger the form's `submit` event which Naja relies on.

However, in modern browsers, you can use the native `form.requestSubmit()` to trigger the form submission in a way that Naja can notice and process:

```js
selectBox.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
	event.target.form.requestSubmit();
});
```

### Manual interaction with a non-supported element

For all non-standard use cases, there is a `processInteraction()` helper method that allows you to hook Naja onto any custom interaction, and have it dispatch the `interaction` event properly:

```js
customButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
	naja.uiHandler.processInteraction(
		customButton, // interaction target
		'GET', // method
		customButton.dataset.targetUrl, // url
		null, // data
		{history: false}, // options
		event, // original UI event
	);
});
```

?> The `processInteraction()` helper is available since version 3.1.0.


## Interaction event

Whenever the user clicks a Naja-bound element, the `interaction` event is dispatched. It contains the clicked element, the original UI event (unless the interaction was triggered manually), and the current request's `options` object that you can modify. You can also call the event's `preventDefault()` to prevent the request from being dispatched:

```js
naja.uiHandler.addEventListener('interaction', (event) => {
	if (event.detail.element.hasAttribute('data-confirm')
        && ! window.confirm(event.detail.element.getAttribute('data-confirm'))
    ) {
		event.preventDefault();
	}
});
```

This event is particularly useful for configuring the behaviour of extensions based on the DOM elements and their attributes:

```js
naja.uiHandler.addEventListener('interaction', (event) => {
	if (event.detail.element.hasAttribute('data-spinner-target')) {
		const spinnerSelector = event.detail.element.getAttribute('data-spinner-target');
		event.detail.options.spinner = document.querySelector(spinnerSelector);
	}
});
```


## Delegated binding

Since version 3.3.0, you can also opt into event delegation for Naja's UI binding. That way, instead of binding directly to `.ajax` elements, Naja binds itself to `body`, listens to all clicks and form submissions, and only then decides whether to act upon them, or let the browser handle them.

This might decrease time to interactive in situations where you have a huge number of `.ajax` elements on a page, because Naja doesn't have to iterate over so many interaction targets. On the other hand, this may introduce unnecessary function calls if you have a lot of non-AJAX interactivity within your application. You are advised to do your own benchmark and decide accordingly.

You can switch to delegated binding this way:

```js
naja.uiHandler.binding = 'delegated';
```

This has to be configured before Naja is initialized and cannot be changed later.
